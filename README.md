# MathHub News

This repository serves as the source for MathHub News Ticker. 
It is generated using a standard [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site and can be generated locally using:

    jekyll build

In addition to a normal jekyll output, a file `news.json` is generated. 
This file is then read by the MathHub Frontend to render the news to the user.
