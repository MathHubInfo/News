title:  Theory Graph Viewer in MathHub
tags: Sys
---

We have added a theory graph viewer to MathHub.
TGView is available at https://mathhub.info/mh/mmt/graphs/tgview.html and can present arbitrary theory graphs whose graph data is generated by MMT.
For instance, the Math-in-the-Middle ontology can be seen as https://mathhub.info/mh/mmt/graphs/tgview.html?type=pgraph&graphdata=htt...
Details can be found in a [paper submitted to MathUI 2017](http://kwarc.info/kohlhase/submit/mathui17-tgview.pdf).
