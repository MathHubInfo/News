MathHub has been updated to [release 16.0.0](https://github.com/MathHubInfo/Frontend/releases/tag/v16.0.0). 
It corresponds to [MMT Release 16](https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT/releases/tag/v16.0.0).
It contains the following changes: 

- migration to using [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) as a framework
  - strict separation of ui and functional components
  - this will enable new programmers to easily contribute by changing the MathHub UI without breaking any of the functional components. 
- primitive integration of [TGView](https://github.com/UniFormal/TGView) using the new TypeScript code
  - in the near future, pending an update of the backend, this will enable a deep integration of Graphs into MathHub
