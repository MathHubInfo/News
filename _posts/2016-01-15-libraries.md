---

In the [DFG OAF project](http://kwarc.info/projects/OAF) we build translations from theorem prover libraries to OMDoc/MMT and host them on MathHub for management. We have started working on

* [HOL4](http://gl.mathhub.info/HOL4)
* [HOL Light](http://gl.mathhub.info/HOLLight)
* [TPS](http://gl.mathhub.info/TPS)
* [Coq](http://gl.mathhub.info/Coq)
