The library of the [IMPS Library](https://gl.mathhub.info/IMPS/imps-library) is now hosted here on MathHub.
It contains the collected theory library of the [IMPS Theorem Prover](http://imps.mcmaster.ca/).

As part of the OAF project, Jonas Betzendahl has implemented a translation into MMT/OMDoc. In two stages,
it first extracts a JSON representation of the [IMPS Internal Data Structures](https://gl.mathhub.info/IMPS/theories)
and creates the OMDoc representation from that and the IMPS source files.

The MathHub Archive can be found at the following URL: https://gl.mathhub.info/IMPS/imps
