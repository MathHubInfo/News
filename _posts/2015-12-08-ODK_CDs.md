title:: OpenDreamKit Content Dictionaries
---

The [OpenDreamKit Project](http://opendreamkit.org) (ODK) funded by the European Union has started in September. [KWARC](http://kwarc.info) is responsible for WP6, which tries to make ODK systems interoperable by connecting them via a "Math-in-the-Middle Ontology" of content dictionaries (OMDoc/MMT theories really) generated from the systems as interfaces. We are hosting these on MathHub naturally. They are at http://mathhub.info/ODK.
