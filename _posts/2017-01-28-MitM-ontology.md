title: Starting the Math-in-the-Middle Ontology on MathHub
---
The Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) Ontology is a concept from the [OpenDreamKit Project](http://opendreamkit.org). It is intended as a curated set mathematical concepts that serve as a platonic concept space that can be used to make mathematical software systems interoperable (WP6 in OpenDreamKit). We have to start at some point with curating materials for the MitM ontology, and we already have a (small) amount of [seed content](http://mathhub.info/MitM).
