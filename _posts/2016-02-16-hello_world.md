title: Hello World Repositories on MathHub
---
To make the creation of content on [MathHub.info](http://mathhub.info) simpler for beginners, we have developed a set of [Hello World Examples](http://mathhub.info/HelloWorld) for SMGloM, sTeX-based course materials, problems, and exams, and MMT. To make a new math archive the closest Hello World repository can just be forked and built upon.
