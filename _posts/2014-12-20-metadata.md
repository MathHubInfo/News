title: Reorganized metadata handling and help in MathHub.info
---
We have reorganized the way metadata is handled in MathHub.info. Much of the documentation and metadata is moved into the repositories, either into the`META-INF` subdirs in the math archives or into the `meta-inf` repositories of the libraries. This gives rise to a much more persistent and scalable architecture.
