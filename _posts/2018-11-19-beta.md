MathHub has a new beta portal: http://beta.mathhub.info tracks [the `devel` branch](https://github.com/MathHubInfo/Frontend/tree/devel) whereas the stable http://mathhub.info tracks [the `master` branch](https://github.com/MathHubInfo/Frontend). 

The beta portal is intended for community testing the development version of Mathhub and giving a preview of coming features.
