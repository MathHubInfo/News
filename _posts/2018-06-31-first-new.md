title: First (marginally functional) prototye on new.MathHub.info
---
We have a first marginally functional prototype on http://new.mathhub.info. The docker swarm that constitutes the MathHub back-end (see the [documentation](https://github.com/MathHubInfo/MathHub)) is functional and the MMT generates JSON content reports, which are picked up by a [Front-end](http://github.com/MathHubInfo/FrontEnd) based on [React.JS]{https://reactjs.org).

Once this setup reaches rough feature parity with the old MathHub portal we will switch over.
