title: MathHub.info is online
---
The MathHub system is online, it is intended both as

* an archive of flexiformal documents and libraries of mathematical knowledge -ranging from fully formal developents to informal documents)
* a portal for active mathematical documents based on these

The archive aspect is realized using GIT repositories in http://gl.mathhub.info, a [GitLab](http://gitlab.com) instance serving and administering the repositories. The flexiformal documents and libraries are represented in the [OMDoc](http://omdoc.org) format and activated by the [MMT](http://uniformal.github.io). A [Drupal](http://drupal.org)-based front-end combines these two and manages user functions.
