The [MiKoMH library](http://mathhub.info/MiKoMH) is now hosted on MathHub, it contains the course materials (slides and course notes) of six courses and scientific talks flexiformally preloaded in [sTeX](http://github.com/KWARC/sTeX). Problems and exams in sTeX also exist on MathHub but are private.
