title: Reimplementing MathHub.info without Drupal
tags: Sys
---
We have decided that we will not invest into re-building the compromised Drupal installation of the MathHub.info front-end, but instead re-implement MathHub.info using docker, webpack, and React.JS.

We have retired the old Mathhub server to the local network (http://http://10.188.48.202/) for reference and copying and have started to set up the new architecture at http://github.com/MathHubInfo. The development server will be available at http://new.mathhub.info.
